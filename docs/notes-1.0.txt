Tauray v1.0 release
---------------------

Tauray is a real-time rendering framework, with a focus on distributed
computing, scalability, portability and low latency. It uses C++17 and Vulkan,
primarily relying on the cross-vendor ray tracing extensions, but comes with a
fallback rasterization mode that can be used on devices that do not have that
extension.

Tauray development is led by the [VGA research group](https://webpages.tuni.fi/vga/)
in Tampere University. The project is described in a conference publication ([DOI link](https://doi.org/10.1145/3550340.3564225)),
which includes performance benchmarks and more information on Tauray.
[A pre-print is available.](https://webpages.tuni.fi/vga/publications/Tauray2022.pdf)
