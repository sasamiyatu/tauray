| The famous "Sponza" scene with teapots. 1920x1080 image (4096 spp, 4 bounces), rendered with Tauray in 18 seconds on a dual-GPU setup with RTX 3090 and RTX 2080 Ti. |

Tauray is a real-time rendering framework, with a focus on distributed computing, scalability,
portability and low latency. It uses C++17 and Vulkan, primarily relying on the `VK_KHR_ray_tracing`
extension, but comes with a fallback rasterization mode that can be used on devices that
do not have that extension.

Tauray is developed by the [VGA research group](https://webpages.tuni.fi/vga/)
in Tampere University. [The pre-print](https://webpages.tuni.fi/vga/publications/Tauray_preprint.pdf)
includes performance benchmarks and more information on Tauray. All of the
measurements in the pre-print publication are done with the
[v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/vga-group/tauray/releases/tag/v1.0.0). For
practical purposes however, we recommend always using the latest available
release instead, as there are bug fixes and additional features included.

## License

Tauray is licensed under LGPL version 2.1. You can find the license text in
[COPYING.LESSER](COPYING.LESSER). External dependencies in the `external`
folder have their own licenses specified either at the start of each file or as
separate license text files.

## Building

Clone the repository recursively with
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/vga-group/tauray/`.

Tauray has been tested on the Ubuntu 22.04 operating system. Building on Ubuntu
22.04 can be done as follows:

1. Install dependencies: `sudo apt install build-essential cmake libsdl2-dev libglm-dev libczmq-dev libnng-dev libcbor-dev vulkan-tools libvulkan-dev vulkan-validationlayers libxcb-glx0-dev glslang-tools`
2. `cmake -S . -B build`
3. `cmake --build build`
4. `build/tauray my_scene.glb`

Building with Windows is also possible but not recommended. You can use the
CMakeLists.txt with Visual Studio. A vcpkg.json is provided in this repository
to handle dependencies with Windows builds. Note that multi-GPU rendering is not
supported on Windows.

## Usage

To launch a simple interactive path tracing session with the included test model:

```bash
build/tauray test/test.glb
```

[See the user manual for more detailed usage documentation.](docs/MANUAL.md)

## Benchmarking with Tauray

To measure representative benchmarks with Tauray, please build a release build
and **disable validation**:

1. Delete your existing build directory (if applicable)
2. `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
3. `cmake --build build`
4. `build/tauray --validation=off -t my_scene.glb`

You may also want to set `--force-double-sided` for better performance if your
scene does not require single-sided surfaces. Also, remember to set
`--max-ray-depth` appropriately for the type of benchmark, the default is quite
high.

By default, Tauray will use all GPUs with support for the required extensions.
If you wish to use a specific GPU on a multi-GPU system, use `--devices=0` (or
any other index; the first thing Tauray prints is the devices it picked.)

In the output with the `-t` flag, lines starting with `HOST: ` are total
frametimes, which you most likely want to measure. The first few frametimes of
a run can be weird as in-flight frames haven't been queued properly and some
initialization still runs, so please exclude those if possible.
`--warmup-frames` can also be used for this purpose.

[See the user manual for more detailed info on configuring Tauray for you benchmark setup.](docs/MANUAL.md)
